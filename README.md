# Shenandoah_MIRROR

This Repo contains a scraped, full mirror of the [Shenandoah Literary](https://shenandoahliterary.org/) site as of 04/03/2019...

You can access the .html code for the readings directly in GitHub by browsing through the files:
shenandoahliterary.org  /  [Vol# | Issue# 1/2]  /  title of work  /  index.html


For example:
goto: shenandoahliterary.org / 621 / wings-1989 / index.html
for Volume 62, Issue 1: [Wings, 1989](https://shenandoahliterary.org/621/wings-1989/), by Robin MacArthur...

Once you click on the target 'index.html' file, search (Ctrl+F) and paste "entry-content" to jump to the content formatted in .html...



**!Notice: The coding team is aware that the file hierarchy differs in several issues. Some of the text content may be in a subfolder of the year, e.g.:**

shenandoahliterary.org  /  [Vol# | Issue# 1/2]  /  **[YEAR]** /  title of work  /  index.html
